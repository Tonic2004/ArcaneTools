# ArcaneTools
Arcane Odyssey Tools by jhxu/amechanos. Use to your own discretion and read the official in-game [rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oh7TLdW6aN6mAyk55BDF_ga-eMl_nHNECo2Bmqa71XA/edit?usp=sharing) to minimise account bans or deletion. 

## Features
- Collection of small utilities and helpers for tooling workflows
- Scripts and examples to automate common tasks
- Configuration-driven so you can adapt tooling to your environment

## Requirements
- Git
- Python 3.8+ (or runtime indicated by specific scripts)
- pip (for Python dependencies) or Node.js if the project contains JavaScript tooling
- See the repository files (requirements.txt / package.json) for exact dependency lists

## Using Each Mod

### Autofish
- To launch and run autofish, open command prompt (or any similar application) and type:
  ```python path/to/the/file/autofish.py``` to run it. You will need to cast your rod and eat periodically, as it is not an advanced autofish mod where it will automate everything.

## Safety & Legal
- The authors and repository maintainers are not responsible for account bans, data loss, or other consequences from misuse.
